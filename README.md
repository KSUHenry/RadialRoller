VER 1.0

Hello and welcome to Radial Roller!
This is designed to be a lightweight extension for roll20 to improve accessibility for users who have a hard time selecting smaller character sheet elements. The radial menu style is utilized to improve ease of access

HOW TO USE: simple install the chrome extension through the chrome store and load Roll20! 
OF NOTE: in order to use the functions, you NEED to enter your character name in the form at the top of the extension. Unfortunately, you need to do this on every page at the moment. Chrome should cache whatever name you enter, so it'll get faster once you do it once
Simply select the d20 symbol in the center of the popup window to open the menu (at current you have to do this on every page)
After entering your character name, select one of the buttons to perform an action or take you to the next page to select one of their actions. See the key below to understand each of the symbols.

CAMPFIRE - Hit Dice Roll (rolls 1 hit die)
PERSON - Ability Rolls
MEDKIT - Saving Throws
TOOLS - Skills (there are three pages of skills in alphabetical order as they are on the standard 5e character sheet)
HAZARD - Initiative
SKULL - Death Saving Throw
HOUSE - Return to the main menu
LEFT ARROW - Return to previous page
RIGHT ARROW - Move to next page

Skills are a special case where they have all been abbreviated into a 4-character key
